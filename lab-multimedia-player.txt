    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    <p>This video walks you through how the JavaScript <code>map()</code> method works.  It shows how to use it to transform arrays without modifying the original data. For example, you can take an array of numbers and return a new array where each number is doubled. The method takes a callback function as an argument, and applies that function to each item in the array. By the end, you'll be confident using <code>map()</code> in your own code to write more efficient and readable JavaScript.
